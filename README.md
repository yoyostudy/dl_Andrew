# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

👏 This repository is a record and the note I took for the course Deep Learning Specialization in Coursera

The reason I am creating this repository are the following:

1. Taking notes help me to organize the content so as to have a deeper understanding of it.

2. I can frequently review my notes to refresh my memory and uncover shortcomings

3. Some of the induction in the video is incomplete, and I try to complete those missed part because I really hate omitting those important details. 😠
